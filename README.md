## Project

NPS-NLW is an application that consists of calculating the company's NPS. In it we make the registration of users, registration of surveys, sending e-mail for users to answer the satisfaction surveys and with this we can perform the calculation of the NPS.

This project was developed during the NodeJS trail, in the fourth edition of NLW. We learned concepts about what an API is, how to start a project using Typescript and Express for route management, TypeORM for data manipulation, automated tests and sending e-mail.
